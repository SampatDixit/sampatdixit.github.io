Consistency in attendance promotes continuity in learning and identify gaps. So, any academy must prioritize daily student attendance. However, taking attendance is quite a montonous activity (if done manually with attendance registers) and is often neglected in many academies.  

These 5 reasons below shows you why attendance is required and its importance to your academy:

1. [Student regularity](#student-regularity)
2. [Planning batch intake](#planning-batch-intake)
3. [Fees-calculation](#fees-calculation)
4. [Identify inactive members](#identify-inactive-students)
5. [Batch structuring](#batch-structuring)

## 1. Student Regularity {#student-regularity}

Regular attendance is a window into a student's commitment and interest in any task. Being an academy owner, you must monitor student's regularity, to get insights into a student's engagement or interest. Regularity is one of the key indicator to know whether the student is involved in coaching and know his/her long-term commitment with the academy.

## 2. Planning batch intake {#planning-batch-intake}

Daily attendance tracking aids in strategically planning your badminton class batches. Particularly effective for beginner and intermediate levels, this approach optimizes class size without compromising instructional quality. Thus, a balanced coaching environment between students and coaches is made.


## 3. Fees calculation {#fees-calculation}

Tracking attendance is crucial for accurate **fee calculation**, especially when charges are session-based, or compensation classes are offered for missed sessions. Without attendance records, monitoring and accounting for every session attended or missed classes becomes challenging. So, maintain student attendance daily to avoid any discrepancies in later stages.


## 4. Identify inactive students {#identify-inactive-students}

Daily attendance helps to know which members are irregular or inactive. At times, students quit academy without informing the academy team or coaches. So, if you track their attendance, you can easily catch up on these anomalies and have a follow-up with the student.

## 5. Batch structuring {#batch-structuring}

Monitoring attendance reveals popular time slots or full batches, allowing strategic planning. Consider expanding those sessions or adjusting others to accommodate demand. This helps ensure efficient scheduling and maximizes coaching effeciency.

## [Bonus tip] : Staff and Coach attendance
It is equally important for you to know if your staff/coach are on time (in-case of multiple coach or multi-location scenario). It will help you in multiple ways, including salary calculations, coach's regularity etc. Irregular coach leads to high dissatisfaction with parents/students and may lead to students leaving the academy.
