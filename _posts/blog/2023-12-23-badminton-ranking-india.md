## How Is Ranking Calculated?

The [BAI (Badminton Association of India)](https://www.badmintonindia.org/) calculates playersâ€™ ranking at the national level, and each state badminton association calculates raking at the state level. 

It is calculated as follows:



1. The top results for each player from the total ranking tournaments held in the last 52 weeks (a specified number of tournaments) are considered. Players / pairs win basic points according to how far they progress in the draw of a particular tournament. e.g.: if you win a tournament, you get the most points. If you're the runner-up, you get the next highest points. It continues this way, with semi-finalists and so on, each earning fewer points.
2. The total points for an individual player is obtained by adding 6 highest points scored in tournaments during the previous 52 week period (players who have competed in six or fewer events are worked out by taking total points they have won).
3. The players are ranked from the highest to the lowest points, so the one with the most points is **ranked as No. 1**.


## How Do I Check National Rankings?

The National rankings(BAI rankings) are constantly released and made accessible after each tournament on the official BAI website (or respective state association website for state-rankings). Visit the [player ranking](https://www.badmintonindia.org/beta/players/rankings/senior/) section on the official website to check the current No. 1 in each category. This provides a transparent and easily accessible platform for individuals to check ranking and stay updated.

Based on points and performance, the National/BAI Ranking system determines eligibility and seeding, influencing opportunities at various levels.
