## How to Get Started with Reports {#get-started}
To have the right academy reports, you need to have the right data in place and in a structured manner. Capturing and recording data properly helps you generate reports easily. Managing data manually in notebooks can be cumbersome and tedious. Instead, you can use an Excel sheet or software like [Badmintonbuddy DRIVE](https://badmintonbuddy.com/apps?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=seven-report-blog-2024&utm_content=top-link) to get reports automatically.

## Essential Reports For Your Academy {#essential-reports}

1. **Student Joining and Drop-Off Report**: This report helps track trends in student enrollment and drop-outs. Understanding why students are joining or leaving the academy enables management to focus on what works and address any underlying issues causing students to leave.

2. **Fees Paid and Pending Report**: Although fees are typically collected monthly, there are often pending payments. This report identifies the total amount pending and lists the students who owe fees. It’s crucial for timely follow-ups to ensure all dues are collected.

3. **Batch Status Report**: Coaching is conducted in batches, and maintaining an optimal number of students in each batch is essential for quality training. This report helps monitor the number of students in each batch, ensuring balance and effectiveness in coaching.

4. **Enquiry Report**: Enquiries are potential leads for new admissions. This report tracks all inquiries, enabling the academy to follow up and convert these into actual admissions, thus boosting the academy’s growth.

5. **Attendance Report**: Student attendance is vital for several reasons. It shows how engaged students are in their training and can indicate if a student is likely to continue. Regular attendance also helps assess how well a student is grasping the lessons.

6. **Student Demographics Report**: Knowing the age categories of students is particularly helpful in designing appropriate batches and coaching methods. Grouping students of similar ages can keep them engaged and suitably challenged during practice sessions.

7. **Staff Attendance Report**: Besides student-related reports, tracking staff attendance is equally important. This report monitors the regularity of coaches, managers, and other staff, which is essential for ensuring quality coaching and managing salary-related matters.
