### The Data-Led Guide Every Academy Owner Needs

In sports, performance is tracked meticulouslyâ€”scores, match stats, rankings. But when it comes to managing a sports academy, too many owners are flying blind.  

They don't need more paperworkâ€”they need numbers that matter, at a glance.  

Whether you're running a badminton academy or a multi-sport facility, tracking key metrics weekly gives you the power to make better decisions, act faster, and grow smarter.

### Why Weekly Tracking Matters

A week is long enough to see trends but short enough to take action. Waiting till month-end often means missing warning signs or growth opportunities.  

Just 15 minutes a week with the right dashboard can:

- Highlight low attendance in specific batches  
- Catch unpaid fees before they pile up  
- Show if your recent marketing campaign actually worked  
- Help you retain players and scale smartly

### The 5 Core Numbers Every Academy Owner Should Track Weekly

#### 1. Revenue Collected This Week
**Why it matters:** Cash flow keeps your academy running. Monitoring weekly collections shows if payments are on track and identifies delays early.  

**Track:**
- Total fees received this week  
- Pending dues (new & overdue)  
- Payment mode breakdown (cash, UPI, online)

#### 2. Fee Dues & Follow-ups
**Why it matters:** Delayed dues can quietly grow into massive losses. Weekly tracking keeps you proactiveâ€”not reactive.  

**Track:**
- Number of players with unpaid dues  
- Total amount overdue  
- Follow-ups sent vs pending

#### 3. Batch Fill Rate
**Why it matters:** Under-filled or overcrowded batches affect player experience and coach productivity.  

**Track:**
- Capacity vs actual attendance per batch  
- Batches below 50% fill  
- Batches over 100% capacity

#### 4. Attendance % by Batch & Player
**Why it matters:** Attendance shows you whoâ€™s serious, whoâ€™s slipping, and where coach engagement might need attention.  

**Track:**
- Weekly average attendance %  
- Players with 2 or more missed sessions  
- Batch-wise attendance dip

#### 5. Enquiry-to-Student Conversion Rate
**Why it matters:** If you're getting leads but no signups, somethingâ€™s brokenâ€”maybe in follow-up, pricing, or trial quality.  

**Track:**
- Enquiries received this week  
- Trials scheduled  
- New joins from enquiries
