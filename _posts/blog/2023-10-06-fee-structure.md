There are primarily two ways to generate monthly recurring income for your academy.

**1. Memberships**<br>
**2. Coaching**

#### Memberships
Memberships is where you allocate a slot (a particular time/day) for players(i.e. members) to come and play. It’s more like renting out the court for a fixed period of time (in advance and bulk booking).

Most of the time, these players form a group and do the booking, and at times academy helps and facilitates in forming a group.

###### Membership Fee structure
**Fee cycle** — Mostly charged on a quarterly or semi/annual basis (Few academies do monthly membership — this needs more tracking and follow-up)

**Fee mode** — All memberships are paid in advance and renewals are calculated based on the date of membership (hard to track but flexible) or at the start of the month.

#### Coaching
Coaching is where you train the kids/adults and help them learn badminton skills. For the most part, coaching is focused on children and teenagers and a few academies also have a separate batch for working professionals or badminton enthusiasts.

###### Coaching Fee structure
**Fee cycle** — most popular is the monthly fee structure. Some professional academies get fees on a quarterly basis.

**Fee mode** — All fees are paid in advance and renewals are calculated based on the date of joining or start of the month. Some academies also charge based on the number of sessions.

*Note: In coaching, attendance is one of the major factor to track the completion of fee cycle (especially session-wise). At times they also expect compensation for missed classes and this is most commonly seen across academies.*
