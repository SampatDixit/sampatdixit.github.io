Are you planning to start a new academy or already have an academy and want to run it more effeciently. These 10 points should help you acheive you dream badminton academy.

#### 1. Objective of your academy
Set clear goals and objectives for your badminton academy. This would help you be focused towards your goals and plan the academy activities or design coaching programs accordingly.

:bulb: **Example**

*Provide a friendly environment to members with best in class facilities. Build top ranked players(if coaching is your strength).*


#### 2. Pricing/fee structure

Set a proper and competitive [pricing/fee structure](/blog/fee-structure-badminton-academy) for your memberships, coaching classes and hourly slots. These are your main [sources of income](/blog/badminton-sources-of-income)for your academy.

Itâ€™s also important that you have a clear system in place to record all the fees collected and also track all the pending fees and follow-up (this is one of the most challenging task which most academies face within India).


#### 3. Safe and Friendly environment

Create a welcoming, safe, and fun environment for your students and members. This will help to foster a sense of community and camaraderie. This would also help spread the word of mouth for your academy.


#### 4. Stay Organised

Create an effective system to track student/member information, attendance, fees, and schedules. Having a proper system from day 1 helps you in focusing on growing your academy rather than worrying about operational stuff.

Invest in quality coaching. Quality coaches can help you attract more customers. A great team of coaches can make all the difference in the success of your academy.

#### 6. Proper Scheduling (batches)
Plan and organize in batches so that you can accommodate members as well as students. Offer multiple batches with different timings based on the court availability and demand (evenings are usually reserved for coaching, mornings and late nights for memberships).

Plan to keep some stock of badminton accessories like shuttles which are needed by players on a day-to-day basis. Many academies also provide shoes and rackets on hourly rentals (helps in earning additional revenue)

#### 8. Organize tournaments/events
Try to organize tournaments on a regular basis (this could also be outsourced) so that new players and badminton enthusiasts get to know about the academy and start coming regularly. Establish relationships with local schools, housing complex and other organizations to expand and grow.

#### 9. Promotion
Utilize social media like Instagram and Facebook to promote your academy. Post photos and videos of your facility , training videos etc and engage with potential students and members.

#### 10. Track Financials and Grow
