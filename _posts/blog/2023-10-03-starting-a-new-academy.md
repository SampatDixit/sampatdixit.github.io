#### 1. Objective of your academy
Set clear goals and objectives for your badminton academy. This would help you be focused towards your goals and plan the academy activities or design coaching programs accordingly.

:bulb: **For example:**
*Provide a friendly environment to members with best in class facilities.
Build top ranked players(if your strength is coaching).*

#### 2. Pricing/fee structure

Set a proper and competitive [pricing/fee structure](/blog/fee-structure-badminton-academy) for your memberships, coaching classes and hourly slots. These are your main [sources of income](/blog/badminton-sources-of-income)for your academy.

Itâ€™s also important that you have a clear system in place to record all the fees collected and also track all the pending fees and follow-up (this is one of the most challenging task which most academies face within India).

#### 3. Safe and Friendly environment

Create a welcoming, safe, and fun environment for your students and members. This will help to foster a sense of community and camaraderie. This would also help spread the word of mouth for your academy.

#### 4. Stay Organised

Create an effective system to track student/member information, attendance, fees, and schedules. Having a proper system from day 1 helps you in focusing on growing your academy rather than worrying about operational stuff.

Invest in quality coaching. Quality coaches can help you attract more customers. A great team of coaches can make all the difference in the success of your academy.

#### 6. Proper Scheduling (batches)
Plan and organize in batches so that you can accommodate members as well as students. Offer multiple batches with different timings based on the court availability and demand (evenings are usually reserved for coaching, mornings and late nights for memberships).

#### 7. Accessories and Essentials
Plan to keep some stock of badminton accessories like shuttles which are needed by players on a day-to-day basis. Many academies also provide shoes and rackets on hourly rentals (helps in earning additional revenue).
