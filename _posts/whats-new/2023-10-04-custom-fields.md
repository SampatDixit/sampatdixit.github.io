**Custom Fields** enables academies to define their own fields for capturing student data. 

There are 3 types of field data that can be added 
1. **String field** *(useful for adding data like height, weight, registration no. etc)*
2. **Date field** *(useful to add any date information to the student like inactive date etc)* 
3. **Single select field** *(define a multi-select dropdown options through which you can pick one)*

The video above shows some samples on using each of these field type in detail and also some pre-defined custom fields like registration id, height, weight and skill-sets.
