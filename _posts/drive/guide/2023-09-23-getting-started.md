Badmintonbuddy DRIVE is the one and only software APP designed to manage badminton academies (supporting multi-sports) and is used by more than 200+ academies to manage their day-to-day academy operations.

### The basics ###

The APP works on a basic concept that — all students are part of a batch(or batches) and have some fees assigned.

So start with

1. **Adding a Batch**
2. **Adding Students (with fees, date of joining, other details)** and
3. **Start tracking fees (paid/pending)**
4. **Reports**

attendance and all other academy operations.

Additionally, you can give access to your team members (partners, coaches, managers etc.), track all the enquiries, expenses and get all academy data in a nice report real-time.

## Step-by-step instructions ##

<br/>

### 1. Adding a Batch ###

![Adding a batch!](/assets/img/drive/guide/new-batch-flow.png "New batch flow")

1. Click Batch from the bottom and go to batch list screen and then click **NEW**
2. Add a name to the batch, an optional description, if you have all students within the batch having same fees you can also add fees details and then hit **SAVE**

:bulb: **TIP-** If you have a batch which starts at 4PM you can name the batch as **4–5 PM** batch, that’s easy to recognise and remember.

<br/>

### 2. Add Students for the batch ###

![Adding students!](/assets/img/drive/guide/new-student-flow.png "New student flow")

1. Click on **ADD STUDENT** to add new student information.
2. Add all information related to student like name, phone no, joining date, photo of student etc and click **ADD**

:bulb: **TIP-** Want to add more data for student. Use [Custom fields](../../whats-new/custom-fields)

<br/>

### 3. Start tracking fees (paid/pending) ###

![Fee tracking!](/assets/img/drive/guide/fee-tracking-flow.png "fee tracking flow")

1. Go to **FEES** tab and update last fee paid information by clicking **MARK PAID**. This will automatically start tracking all next due-dates as well as remind them when they are due.

:bulb: **TIP-** Set automatic reminder ON so that you do not want to remind the students/parents when they are due.

<br/>

### 3. Reports ###

![Reports!](/assets/img/drive/guide/report-view.png "reports view")

1. Go to **Reports tab** from the bottom and see all the reports related to academy including Fee report, Student report, Financial reports etc. and download **data in PDF/Excel format**
