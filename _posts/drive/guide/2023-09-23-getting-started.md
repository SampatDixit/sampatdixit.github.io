Badmintonbuddy DRIVE is the one and only software APP designed to manage badminton academies (supporting multi-sports) and is used by more than 200+ academies to manage their day-to-day academy operations.

### The basics ###

The APP works on a basic concept that — all students are part of a batch(or batches) and have some fees assigned.

So start with

1. **Creating a Batch**
2. **Adding Students (with fees, date of joining, other details)** and
3. **Start tracking fees (paid/pending),**

attendance and all other academy operations.

Additionally, you can give access to your team members (partners, coaches, managers etc.), track all the enquiries, expenses and get all academy data in a nice report real-time.

## Step-by-step instructions ##

### 1. Adding a Batch ###

![Adding a batch!](/assets/img/drive/guide/new-batch-flow.png "New batch flow")

1. Click Batch from the bottom and go to batch list screen and then click **NEW**
2. Add a name to the batch, an optional description, if you have all students within the batch having same fees you can also add fees details and then hit **SAVE**

> Tip: If you have a batch which starts at 4PM you can name the batch as 4–5PM batch, that’s easy to recognise and remember.
