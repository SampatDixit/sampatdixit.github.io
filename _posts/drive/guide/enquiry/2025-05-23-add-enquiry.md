Enquiries often come in through walk-ins, phone calls, or social media. With **BadmintonBuddy DRIVE**, you can record all enquiries in one secure, centralized systemâ€”making it easier to track, manage, and follow up effectively.

### Steps to Add Enquiry

1. **Navigate to Home Screen**: Click on **Enquiries** on the top  
2. **Click on New**  
3. **Select Batch** from the list  
4. **Enter Details**: Type the **name** of the student and **phone number**  
5. **Select Date of Enquiry**  
6. **Add Notes** if any (e.g., student will join from 1st of next month, looking for advance coaching, pay and play booking, etc.)  
7. **Click on ADD**

Now the enquiry is added to the enquiries list and can be followed up at any time. When an enquiry turns into an admission, you can directly move it to a student without re-entering the details.
