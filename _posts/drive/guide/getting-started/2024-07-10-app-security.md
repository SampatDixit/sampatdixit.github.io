We understand the importance of your academy data security and privacy and we have most robust measures to handle it :muscle:: 

:point_right: **Secure Servers:** All data transferred is stored on the most secure servers, ensuring your information is protected against unauthorized access.

:point_right: **Controlled Access:** Only you and your [team](../team/adding-team) (with your [permission](../team/team-permissions)) have access to your data. This ensures that your data is only seen by those you trust.

:point_right: **Immediate Access Revocation:** If a team member is removed, they lose access to all data immediately, preventing any future access or misuse of student data.

:point_right: **No Ads or Sharing:** We do not display ads or share your data with any external agencies, maintaining your privacy and avoiding unnecessary intrusions.

:point_right: **Complete Data Deletion:** Upon your request, we delete and erase all data, eliminating any risk of a privacy breach.

:point_right: **Uninterrupted Service:** Our app has maintained no downtime, not even for a minute, over the last seven years, ensuring constant availability and reliability.

Your privacy and security are our top priorities, ensuring a safe, private, and consistently available experience.
