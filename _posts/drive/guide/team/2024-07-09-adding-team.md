You can add your **co-owner, coach, manager or admin** of your academy. Once added you all have access to the same data *(no more sharing data manually)*.
You can [set the right access/permissions](/drive/guide/team/team-permissions) for the team member to allow/restrict different functionalities within the APP. 


You as an owner get real-time updates as your team member adds a new student, or receive a fees, or a new enquiry etc.
