1. **Easy-to-Remember Names**: Some of the naming practice followed by academies are:
   - **Time and Category**: e.g., *7-8 AM BEGINNERS*, *9-10 AM WEEKEND ADULTS*
   - **Frequency**: e.g., *Alternate Days BASIC*, *Weekend ADVANCED*
   - **Court Number**: e.g., *8-9 AM Court 1*, *Membership 7-8 AM Court A*
   - **Skill Level**: e.g., *BASIC BATCH*, *ADVANCED BATCH*, *PROFESSIONAL BATCH*

3. **Specify Batch Days**:
   - Add days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday) for easier filtering and attendance tracking.
