Managing student data can quickly become messy, especially when players leave or take breaks. Keeping everyone on the same page where students are currently active can be confusing and error-prone. With **BadmintonBuddy DRIVE**, we've made it simple to delete students or keep their data separately so that your academy records can be kept clean and up to date ‚Äî all in real time.

### Steps to Delete Student

1. **Navigate to Home Screen**: Click on **Student** button  
2. **Click on All**  
3. **Click on the üóëÔ∏è delete icon** in front of the student  
4. **Choose a Deletion Option**: You will see three options:  
    - **Inactive**  
    - **Dropout pool**  
    - **Delete**  
5. **Inactive**: Select this to retain all data along with fee history and attendance  
   (Best if student is joining back in a few days)  
6. **Dropout pool**: Select this to retain their name, contact details, etc.  
   (Useful if you want to follow up or market new offerings)  
7. **Delete**: Select this option to delete the student permanently. 
8. **Confirm**: Click **OK** to complete the action

For each student, you can choose **Inactive** or **Dropout Pool** to retain their data, or **Delete** to remove it completely.
