### How It Helps

Adding income regularly helps your academy maintain clear and accurate financial records. Recording income entries ensures you have a full picture of your academy’s earnings. It also helps with budgeting, transparency across the team, and preparing reports during audits or reviews.

By tracking all income sources, you can identify which areas are most profitable and make informed decisions. It also reduces dependency on manual records, minimizing errors and saving time during monthly reconciliations.
