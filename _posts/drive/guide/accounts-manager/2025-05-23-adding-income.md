Additional income from sales of items like shuttles, rackets, or water bottles at the academy can become difficult to track—especially when handled by multiple team members. **BadmintonBuddy DRIVE** makes this easier by allowing real-time income entries, so coaches and admins can maintain accurate and consistent financial records.

### Steps to Add Income

1. **Navigate to Home Screen**: Click on the **‘+’** button at the bottom  
2. **Click on Add Income Expense**  
3. **Click on Add Income**  
4. **Select Category**  
5. **Enter Amount**  
6. **Select Date**  
7. **Select Payment Mode**  
8. **Add Notes** if any  
9. **Click on ADD**

Now all your income is recorded in one centralized location, and you can view detailed reports in the **Reports** tab.
