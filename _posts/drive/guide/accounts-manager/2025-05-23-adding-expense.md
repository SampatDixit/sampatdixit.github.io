Running a badminton academy involves many day-to-day expenses — from shuttle purchases and court rentals to salaries and equipment maintenance. When these expenses are recorded in notebooks or spread across chats and spreadsheets, they can quickly become hard to track. **BadmintonBuddy DRIVE** allows you to easily add and manage all your academy expenses in one place, helping you and your team stay organized and financially aware.

### Steps to Add Expense

1. **Navigate to Home Screen**: Click on the **‘+’** button  
2. **Click on Add Income Expense**  
3. **Go to Expense tab** and click on **Add Expense**  
4. **Select Category**  
5. **Enter Amount**  
6. **Select Date**  
7. **Select Payment Mode**  
8. **Add Notes** if any  
9. **Click on ADD**

Now all your expenses are stored in one centralized location, and you can view detailed reports in the **Reports** tab.
