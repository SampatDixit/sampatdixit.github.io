### Sending Reminders and Receipts

Sending automatic **fee reminders** and **receipts** to parents or members is easy with **Badmintonbuddy DRIVE**. It helps ensure timely payments without the need for manual follow-ups. Once a payment is received, the app can automatically send a **fee receipt message**, saving time and improving communication. This ensures both coaches and parents stay informed with proper documentation.

### Steps to Enable Auto Reminders and Receipts

1. **Navigate to Home Page**  
2. Click the **Menu Bar** at the top  
3. Go to **Academy Settings**, then open the **Settings** tab  
4. Click on **Fee Settings**  
5. **Enable AutoReminder Mode** – to send reminders automatically  
6. **Select the Reminder Date** based on your fee collection method:  
   - If your **Due Date Mode** is *Start of Month*, choose a reminder date just after your fee collection window.  
     _Example_: If you collect fees by the 5th, set the reminder date as the 6th. This way, reminders go only to those who haven’t paid within the set period.  
   - If your **Due Date Mode** is *Date of Joining*, reminders will be sent automatically on each student's due date.
7. **Enable AutoReceipt Mode** – to send receipts automatically once fees are received in the app  
8. Click **SAVE**

Now, fee reminders and receipts will be sent automatically. You can change or update these settings anytime.
