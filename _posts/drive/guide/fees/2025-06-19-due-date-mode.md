### Due Date Mode

Collecting and tracking student fees is a core part of running any academy. Generally, academies follow one of two fee collection modes:

1. **Fixed Monthly Due**: Collect fees on the 1st of every month. (If a student joins mid-month, you can charge half-month fees.)
2. **Joining Date-Based Due**: Collect fees based on the student’s joining date. (For example, if a student joins on the 12th, the next due date will be the 12th of the following month.)

Both these modes are available in the **Badmintonbuddy DRIVE** app. You can set the one that fits your academy’s needs — and it's simple to do.

### Steps to Set Due Date Mode

1. **Navigate to Home Page**  
2. **Go to the Menu Bar** at the top of the screen  
3. Click on **Academy Settings**  
4. Click on **Settings**  
5. Click on **Fee Settings**  
6. Choose **Date of Joining** or **1st of Month**, then click **SAVE**

Now, your fee tracking will follow the selected **due date mode**.

> **Tip**: The **Date of Joining** must be entered for each student if you choose the **Joining Date-Based Due** mode.
